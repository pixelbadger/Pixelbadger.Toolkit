This project is a cli toolkit exposing varied functionality.
CLI arguments start with an action, then the required arguments for that action.
For example, the cli arguments "reverse-string --in-file hw.txt --out-file hw-reversed.txt would read the content of in-file and output the reversed strging to the path of out-file.

The project is dotnet 9, and should use Microsoft's console argument configuration extensions for building argument sets.
